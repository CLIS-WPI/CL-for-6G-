*This repository implements the online learning-based adaptive beam switching framework proposed in [arXiv:2505.08032](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08032).  
It features a GRU-based Deep Q-Learning (DQL) agent with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) for real-time beam selection in dynamic 6G environments characterized by user mobility and time-correlated blockage.  
Compared to heuristic and Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) baselines, the proposed method significantly improves throughput, SNR stability, and resilience, as demonstrated through detailed simulations using the Sionna platform.*
