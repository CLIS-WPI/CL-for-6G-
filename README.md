*This project implements the Online Learning-based Adaptive Beam Switching method for 6G networks proposed in arXiv:2505.08032.
It leverages a GRU-based Deep Q-Learning (DQL) agent with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) for real-time beam selection in dynamic environments with user mobility and time-correlated blockage.
Compared to heuristic and Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) baselines, this approach improves throughput, SNR stability, and resilience in 6G scenarios using Sionna-based simulations
